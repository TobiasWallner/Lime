# Lime - The command line editor

Lime is a text editor that works directly in the terminal. It aims to take features of some of the best and most popular editors out there.  

 **Vim / NeoVim** Is a very powerful keyboard-only text editor that proviedes a lot of different ways to edit and navigate a text file. Thus it repurposes the same keys and key combinations with different modes like the *insert-mode*, *normal-mode*, *visual-mode* and more. Lime aims to take the idea of being a keyboard-only editor that can look and feel like an IDE without the need to switch between different modes all the time. NeoVim inspired the integration of a file tree and project viewer as well as console passthrough. 
 
 **Emacs** Emacs was a ground breaking editor for its time and still has many lovers today, especially for its customisations. Lime takes this as an inspiration to configurate the colours and appearance of the editor as well as syntax highlighting for the extfile. 
 
 **nano** nano is a very small and light weight editor that helps its useres by showing them the commands and shortcuts at hand. Many of its shortcuts are still used today like Ctrl-S to save and Ctrl-F to find. Modern Software has advanced and uses many more key-shortcuts and features that mostly everyone intuetively knows. Lime will take this mindset and advances it to give the user the modern intuitive experience and smoothly guides the user.  
 
 **Computer games** use the keys 'W'-up, 'A'-left, 'S'-down, 'D'-right for movement and navigation. Lime is inspired to use those or the same layout for the other hand with 'I'-up, 'J'-left, 'K'-down, 'L'-right for navigation as well.
